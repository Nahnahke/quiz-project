# Redux quiz group project

This is a multiple-choice quiz game built using React and Redux, where users can test their trivia knowledge by answering questions and getting feedback on their answers. It's a group project made by Hannah Ek, Sofia Gerdmar, Camilla Cronqvist and Matilda Frid as part of the Technigo Web Development Bootcamp.

## The problem

This project was our introduction to Redux, so a lot of time was spent researching new concepts and tools. We had a starter code containing a few pre-defined reducers that we could use to set everything up. 

The first meeting we had a brainstorming session where we came up with a theme, discussed how we wanted to work with the project together and made a Figma board to keep track of everything and collect inspiration. For the second meeting we did a mob-programming session where we set up the React components, the main functionality and logic of the application. Then we divided the work between us and worked individually, where everyone got to do a little bit of both styling and javascript.
